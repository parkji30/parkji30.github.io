            <h1>Research Is Not For Me</h1>
            <h2 class="date">May 13, 2025</h2>
            <p>
                I've worked as in research roles for about 5 years now. 2 years in grad school developing a math model 
                for measuring magnetic field strengths in stars. 1 at TD for developing NLP models on classification problems, 
                and 2 at Xanadu developing AI models for scientific research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always had some form of fomo/regret on not following through with my PhD program.  Primarily, I think this
                came from a place of pride, where my primary motivation for doing a PhD was to tell everyone I did a PhD- therefore,
                I am smart. Yeah, I know, you're probably thinking "what an insecure guy", and you'd be right to say that. I honestly 
                thought I would never overcome this insecurity until I dove into a PhD and followed through with it; however, 2 events 
                occured that helped me grow out of this.

            <h3>Failing Big Tech</h3>
            <p> 
                Recently, I interviewed for the coveted Applied Scientist position at Amazon for the Alexa team. Overall, I had good feedback
                but I wasn't moved forward due to my lack of experience in LLMs and their applications. This role is probably among the top of 
                what I can achieve in Toronto (<em>Yes I know the U.S. is better but Toronto is my home</em>). In fact, I was told there was no 
                cooldown for me, which is typically what happens when you fail an interview and the recruiter topped it off by asking me to message 
                him again within 3 months time, with the caveat of obtaining some LLM experience by then. From what I understood, the interviewer
                seemed to like me but couldn't move me forward since they were hiring for a new team and needed someone who could immediately
                make an impact with minimal onboarding. Fair enough.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This is a role I've seen PhD graduates from top schools obtain (MIT, Stanford, UoFT, etc.) and I was almost there without one. Then 
                came another further dumb realization (<em>dumb because it never really struck me</em>)- I was working in a top research lab in 
                Quantum Computing where every other guy in the company has a PhD, and I was delivering high impact results that directly influenced 
                how we designed our quantum computer. 2 of my teammates in my ML team also have PhDs and also praised me on my M.L. abilities 
                and ability to deliver high impact results. My mind started to shift from "Can I get there?" to "What are the remaining steps to
                get there?"
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the hardest challenges in tech, is getting that opportunity. The roles I wanted to go for were all heavily specialized and 
                were typically filled by PhD graduates. Let me tell you first hand that you don't need a PhD to work in these specialized roles and 
                I am starting to see a trend in the industry where companies are realizing that they can get high quality candidates with relevant experience. However,
                with that being said, I highly recommend you still do a research Masters degree and get a couple years of experience at a high impact /
                well known company. A combination of both will make you just as desirable as a PhD candidate. After all, all profit based companies 
                need people who can deliver results to make money. Hardly any industrial research lab will operate similar to an academic research lab.
                It's all about the money (<em>more on what this means</em>) and if you can show that without a PhD, you're a strong candidate for that role.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Application is more Fun</h3>
            <p>
                I will say, research is great for diving deep on fundamentals. For one of my projects at Xanadu, I had to design the transformer architecture
                from scratch using <a href="https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/all-of-equinox/" target="_blank">Equinox</a>. This project is where 
                I had my eye-opening moment in machine learning. All the concepts started to glue together and I really understood the math, intuition and idea 
                that each layer in my models were doing. This project is also where I realized I dreaded the idea of research. It reminded me of my Masters Thesis 
                project where I had to sit and think about the math for hours with no results.
