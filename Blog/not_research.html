            <p>
                I've worked as in research roles for about 5 years now. 2 years in grad school developing a math model 
                for measuring magnetic field strengths in stars, 1 at TD for developing NLP models, and 2 at 
                Xanadu developing AI models for scientific research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To give some background lore, I've always had some form of fomo/regret on not following through with my PhD 
                program.
