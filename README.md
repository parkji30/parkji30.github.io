I made this blog to help individuals who face the same insecurities and struggles as myself when it comes to specialized roles in big tech.

This is just one persepective out of many and may conflict with other people's perspectives and opinions; however, I do believe that are common truths that can be found from majority of scenarios and I am hoping something I wrote can provide you with exactly that.
