                    Hello, I'm James Park. I'm a software/research engineer at Xanadu Quantum Technologies where I work on deploying scientific tools and models for quantum photonic hardware. 
                    I've worked across various teams here at Xanadu, from the Photonics team to the Measurement Based Quantum Computing team.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    I've decided to create this blog to write down my thoughts and keep track of my projects and learning. I also want to use this as an opportunity explain in detail any interesting ideas or
                    topics I've learned about. My greatest weakeness in undergrad and graduate school was rushing to finish my work which often led to a surface level understanding of the material. This hindered my growth
                    and affected my research capabilities at an institution like Xanadu. I want to reset and go back to the fudamentals so I can grow as both a researcher and engineer.
