            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Quantum computing is gaining popularity like never before. The fundamental architecture that different quantum computing companies use are quite different.
                from one another. However, whether it is ion traps, superconducting qubits, or linear optics, each one of them will require error correction.
                This is where quantum error correction comes in.

            <p>
                I have dedicated this page to learn more about quantum error correction (QEC) and how it works. Hopefully, one day I will be able to return to quantum computing
                and work as a quantum error correction researcher.
